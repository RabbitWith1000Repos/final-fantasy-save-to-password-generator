# Final Fantasy Save File to Password Generator

A dumb thing I built for
[a Rabbit with 1000 Repos blog post](https://rabbitwith1000repos.com/read/nesstate)
about restoring state in NES games that will turn a Final Fantasy save file
used with emulators into a Mega Man 3-like password grid.

Try it with [one of the save files listed here](https://fantasyanime.com/finalfantasy/ff/ffsaves.htm).
Then imagine trying to type all that in with an NES controller, let alone write it down in a nearly-used
school notebook so you can recreate it later. Aren't you glad that memory management
controllers that could swap in WRAM storage were made?

All the info about the offsets in the file came from
[this GameFAQ](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/nes/522595-final-fantasy/faqs/12630)
and, upon pulling the .sav file into a hex editor, seemed to be correct.

Enjoy!
